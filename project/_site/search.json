    "text": "3 🔍 Analysis\n\n3.1 ❓Motivating Question\n\n🚇💻 How has the rise of remote work since the COVID-19 pandemic impacted New York City subway ridership and transit system dynamics?\n\nRather than assuming a city-wide story, this analysis asks: Where, exactly, did ridership recover, and where did it not? Did neighborhoods with surging remote work see sustained transit losses? Could borough-level commuting trends reveal structural shifts in how different communities depend on the subway?\nThe pandemic forced a once-daily ritual of commuting to become optional for many. But not all ZIP codes, jobs, or boroughs adapted equally. Some workers returned to the office quickly. Others never left. Meanwhile, essential workers continued riding the subway every day, even in the city’s darkest moments.\nBy pairing quantitative remote work data with subway ridership trends, we attempt to untangle how the rise of WFH reshaped urban movement. Instead of looking at raw totals, we explore localized transit recovery, uncovering hidden disparities across neighborhoods and boroughs. Our goal is not only to measure change, but to map how the very purpose of public transit has evolved post-pandemic.\n\n\n3.2 📂 Deconstructing the Commute: Key Questions Explored\nTo explore the motivating question, we break it down into four sub-questions, each addressing a different aspect of the transit–WFH relationship.\n\n\n3.3 📍 Sub-Question 1\nWhich ZIP codes had the largest increase in remote work between 2020 and 2023?\nWe begin by identifying NYC ZIP codes where remote work adoption increased the most. Using ACS 5-year estimates, we calculate changes in the number of workers reporting WFH status and spotlight the neighborhoods driving this shift.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# Ensure ZIPs are 5-digit character strings\nwfh_nyc &lt;- wfh_combined %&gt;%\n  mutate(zip = stringr::str_pad(as.character(zip), 5, pad = \"0\")) %&gt;%\n  filter(zip %in% nyc_zips)\n\n# Get top 10 ZIPs by WFH growth\ntop_10_wfh &lt;- wfh_nyc %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(wfh_change)) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(wfh_change)) %&gt;%\n  slice_head(n = 10)\n\n# Define MTA blue for reuse\nmta_blue &lt;- \"#003366\"\n\n# Render Kable\ntop_10_wfh %&gt;%\n  select(zip, wfh_2020,wfh_2021, wfh_2022, wfh_2023, wfh_change) %&gt;%\n  kable(\n    format = \"html\",\n    col.names = c(\"ZIP Code\", \"WFH in 2020\", \"WFH in 2021\", \"WFH in 2022\", \"WFH in     2023\", \"Change\"),\n    align = \"c\",\n    digits = 0,\n    caption = \"Estimated Remote Work Growth by ZIP Code (Top 10 NYC ZIPs)\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  kable_styling(\n    bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\"),\n    full_width = FALSE,\n    position = \"center\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  row_spec(0, background = mta_blue, color = \"white\", bold = TRUE) %&gt;%\n  column_spec(1:4, background = \"#f8f8f8\", bold = TRUE)\n\n\n\nEstimated Remote Work Growth by ZIP Code (Top 10 NYC ZIPs)\n\n\nZIP Code\nWFH in 2020\nWFH in 2021\nWFH in 2022\nWFH in 2023\nChange\n\n\n\n\n11215\n5821\n9704\n11969\n13626\n7805\n\n\n11201\n5403\n8919\n11321\n13165\n7762\n\n\n10023\n5330\n7637\n10271\n11520\n6190\n\n\n11238\n4411\n7201\n8903\n10456\n6045\n\n\n10016\n4007\n6845\n8040\n9956\n5949\n\n\n11221\n2970\n4994\n7210\n8917\n5947\n\n\n11216\n3624\n6346\n7323\n8855\n5231\n\n\n11222\n2495\n4724\n5999\n7228\n4733\n\n\n11217\n3448\n5361\n7022\n8130\n4682\n\n\n10128\n3869\n5891\n7431\n8300\n4431\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.1 📊 Visualization\n\n📊 ZIP Codes Ranked by Remote Work Growth (2020–2023)\n\n\n\n\n3.3.2 📊 Interpretation & Takeaways\nThe plot above highlights the ZIP codes with the highest increase in remote work between 2020 and 2023. Unsurprisingly, most of these ZIPs are located in Manhattan and affluent parts of Brooklyn, which tend to have higher concentrations of office workers in remote-compatible industries (e.g., finance, tech, media).\nFor example, ZIP codes 11215 (Park Slope) and 11201 (Downtown Brooklyn) show among the highest spikes in WFH adoption, likely due to their professional demographic and proximity to tech and business districts. Manhattan neighborhoods like 10023 (Upper West Side) and 10016 (Murray Hill) also experienced substantial increases.\nThis spike in remote work raises a key hypothesis: ZIP codes with high WFH growth may have seen slower subway recovery, a trend we’ll explore in the next sub-question.\n\n\n\n3.4 🚇 Sub-Question 2\nHow did subway ridership recover in ZIP codes with the highest remote work adoption?\nNext, we focus on the transit recovery patterns in those high-WFH ZIPs. By tracking annual ridership totals from 2020 to 2023, we assess whether increased remote work delayed or dampened the rebound in subway usage.\n\n3.4.1 📊 Visualization\n\n\nCode\n# STEP 1: Reshape subway data into long format\nsubway_long &lt;- subway_all_cleaned %&gt;%\n  select(station, zip, x2020, x2021, x2022, x2023) %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = starts_with(\"x20\"),\n    names_to = \"year\",\n    names_prefix = \"x\",\n    values_to = \"annual_ridership\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    year = as.integer(year),\n    zip = stringr::str_pad(as.character(zip), 5, pad = \"0\")\n  )\n\n# STEP 2: Load or use high-WFH ZIPs from your analysis\n# (These ZIPs had the largest increase in remote work from 2020 to 2023)\nhigh_wfh_zips &lt;- c(\"11215\", \"11201\", \"10023\", \"11238\", \"10016\", \n                   \"11221\", \"11216\", \"11222\", \"11217\", \"10128\")\n\n# STEP 3: Summarize annual ridership for high-WFH ZIPs\nzip_year_ridership &lt;- subway_long %&gt;%\n  filter(zip %in% high_wfh_zips) %&gt;%\n  group_by(zip, year) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    total_ridership = sum(annual_ridership, na.rm = TRUE),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  )\nlibrary(plotly)\n# STEP 4: Plot heatmap with consistent style\nheatmap_plot &lt;- ggplot(zip_year_ridership, aes(x = factor(year), y = fct_reorder(zip, -total_ridership), fill = total_ridership)) +\n  geom_tile(color = \"white\", linewidth = 0.5) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = \"plasma\", name = \"Ridership\", labels = scales::comma) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"🗺 Subway Ridership Heatmap (2020–2023)\",\n    subtitle = \"Hover to view ZIP-wise ridership trends\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"ZIP Code\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14)\n\n# Make interactive\nggplotly(heatmap_plot)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.2 📊 Interpretation & Takeaways\nThe heatmap above visualizes annual subway ridership trends across the ten busiest ZIP codes in New York City from 2020 to 2023. Each tile’s color intensity represents the total ridership volume for a given ZIP code and year — with warmer tones (yellows and oranges) indicating higher ridership and cooler tones (dark purples) indicating lower ridership.\n\nConsistent leaders: ZIP codes like 10035 (East Harlem) and 10007 (Lower Manhattan) stand out with consistently high ridership levels across all years, despite the pandemic-induced drop.\nSteady decline post-2020: Most ZIP codes show a gradual decrease in ridership from 2020 to 2023, reflecting NYC’s sluggish recovery in transit usage following the rise of remote work.\nLower-traffic ZIPs: Several ZIP codes (e.g., 10001, 10002, 10004) exhibit significantly lower ridership values, potentially due to reduced office density or slower economic rebound in those neighborhoods.\n\n\n\n\n3.5 📍 Sub-Question 3\nIs there a negative correlation between remote work growth and transit ridership recovery across ZIP codes?\nTo test our hypothesis more broadly, we calculate correlation coefficients between remote work growth and ridership recovery. Do ZIPs with higher WFH growth generally show weaker subway recovery?

ZIPs are divided into Low, Medium, and High WFH tiers, and the recovery index is tracked annually.\n\nAcross all years, ZIPs with higher remote work growth consistently show lower average subway recovery, especially by 2023.\nIn 2021, Medium-WFH areas rebounded quickly, likely due to more hybrid or in-person work. But by 2023, Low-WFH ZIPs pulled ahead with the strongest recovery, while High-WFH ZIPs remained far below baseline.\n\nThis supports a directional trend: ZIP codes with higher WFH growth tend to recover more slowly in terms of subway usage, reinforcing the long-term impact of remote work on transit behavior.\n\n\n\n3.6 🚇 Sub-Question 4\nDid boroughs with lower remote work shifts see stronger subway recovery?\nFinally, we zoom out to the borough level. By aggregating recovery trends and WFH changes, we assess whether outer boroughs — traditionally more transit-reliant — bounced back faster than Manhattan, the WFH capital.\n\n3.6.1 📊 Visualization\n\n\nCode\n# Start with subway data and keep one row per ZIP-borough combo\n  zip_boro_crosswalk &lt;- subway_all_cleaned %&gt;%\n    distinct(zip, boro) %&gt;%\n    mutate(zip = stringr::str_pad(as.character(zip), 5, pad = \"0\"))\n  \n  # Join borough info to remote work data\n  wfh_boro &lt;- wfh_combined %&gt;%\n    mutate(zip = stringr::str_pad(zip, 5, pad = \"0\")) %&gt;%\n    left_join(zip_boro_crosswalk, by = \"zip\") %&gt;%\n    filter(!is.na(boro))\n  \n  boro_wfh &lt;- wfh_boro %&gt;%\n    group_by(boro) %&gt;%\n    summarise(\n      avg_wfh_change = mean(wfh_change, na.rm = TRUE),\n      .groups = \"drop\"\n    )\n  \n  boro_recovery &lt;- subway_all_cleaned %&gt;%\n    select(boro, zip, x2020, x2021, x2022, x2023) %&gt;%\n    pivot_longer(\n      cols = starts_with(\"x20\"),\n      names_to = \"year\",\n      names_prefix = \"x\",\n      values_to = \"annual_ridership\"\n    ) %&gt;%\n    group_by(boro, year) %&gt;%\n    summarise(total_ridership = sum(annual_ridership, na.rm = TRUE), .groups =         \"drop\") %&gt;%\n    pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = total_ridership) %&gt;%\n    mutate(\n      recovery_2023 = `2023` / `2020`,\n      recovery_2022 = `2022` / `2020`,\n      recovery_2021 = `2021` / `2020`\n    )\n  \n  \n  boro_combined &lt;- boro_recovery %&gt;%\n    left_join(boro_wfh, by = \"boro\")\n\n# Reshape for slope chart\nboro_long &lt;- boro_combined %&gt;%\n  select(boro, recovery_2021, recovery_2022, recovery_2023, avg_wfh_change) %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = starts_with(\"recovery_\"),\n    names_to = \"year\",\n    names_prefix = \"recovery_\",\n    values_to = \"recovery\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  mutate(year = as.integer(year))\n\n# Plot with direct labels\n# Step: Create tidy bar chart data\nboro_bar &lt;- boro_combined %&gt;%\n  select(boro, recovery_2021, recovery_2022, recovery_2023) %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = starts_with(\"recovery_\"),\n    names_to = \"year\",\n    names_prefix = \"recovery_\",\n    values_to = \"recovery\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  mutate(year = as.integer(year))\nboro_bar_clean &lt;- boro_bar %&gt;% filter(!is.na(boro))\n\n\nggplot(boro_bar_clean, aes(x = factor(year), y = recovery, fill = boro)) +\n  geom_col(position = position_dodge(width = 0.75), width = 0.6, color = \"white\") +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(label = paste0(round(recovery * 100), \"%\")),\n    position = position_dodge(width = 0.75),\n    vjust = -0.5,\n    size = 4.5,\n    fontface = \"bold\",\n    color = \"black\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Dark2\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    labels = percent_format(accuracy = 1),\n    limits = c(0, 1.2),\n    expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.1))\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"🚇 Borough-Level Subway Ridership Recovery\\n(2021–2023)\",\n    subtitle = \"Compared to 2020 baseline (100%) — grouped by year and borough\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Recovery (%)\",\n    fill = \"Borough\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 16) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 18, hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 13, hjust = 0.5),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 14),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 13, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),\n    legend.position = \"top\",\n    legend.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 12),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.6.2 📊 Interpretation & Takeaways\nThis grouped bar chart shows subway ridership recovery by borough from 2021 to 2023, benchmarked against 2020 levels.\n\n🚇 In 2021, outer boroughs like The Bronx and Queens showed the strongest rebound, reaching over 85–90% of their pre-pandemic ridership.\n⬇️ By 2023, however, all boroughs saw noticeable drops, with ridership stabilizing around 32–48%, suggesting that initial recovery wasn’t sustained.\n🏙️ Manhattan maintained relatively steadier recovery rates over time, likely due to its concentration of hybrid/remote jobs.\n🚫 Staten Island is not shown, as it is served by the Staten Island Railway, which is reported separately.\n\nThese trends suggest that boroughs with lower WFH growth rebounded faster early on, but long-term ridership recovery remains uneven. Employment type and transit reliance appear to play major roles in borough-level variation.\n\n\n\n3.7 Conclusion ✅\nThis project traced the evolving relationship between remote work and subway ridership in New York City from 2020 to 2023 a period marked by disruption, adaptation, and uneven recovery.\n\n\n3.8 🚦 Connecting the Dots: From Sub-Questions to the Bigger Picture\nBy systematically exploring each of the four sub-questions, we were able to meaningfully address our central motivating question:\n“How has the rise of remote work since the COVID-19 pandemic impacted New York City subway ridership and transit system dynamics?”\nOur analysis revealed that ZIP codes with higher remote work growth tended to experience slower subway ridership recovery, especially in central business districts like Manhattan. Conversely, neighborhoods with lower WFH adoption saw comparatively stronger rebounds. We also observed borough-level disparities and shifts in commuting patterns across years.\nThese findings suggest that remote work has not just temporarily reduced subway usage—it has reshaped urban mobility in lasting ways. The sub-questions allowed us to deconstruct this complex issue and build toward a data-driven understanding of NYC’s evolving transit landscape in the remote work era.\n\n\n3.9 📌 Key Findings\n\n📉 ZIP codes with the largest increases in remote work like 11215 and 11201 showed the slowest subway ridership recovery, especially in central areas like Manhattan.\n📈 Outer boroughs such as The Bronx and Queens, with lower WFH growth, showed stronger recovery likely due to more essential and in-person workforces.\n🔄 The link between remote work and transit recovery is directional but not consistent; recovery levels varied by year and location, suggesting that other factors (like income, job type, or transit service changes) also influence ridership trends.\n\n\n\n3.10 🔮 Future Directions\n\nInclude MTA bus and Staten Island Railway data for a more complete view.\nAnalyze income, occupation, or fare type to refine understanding of ridership changes.\nCompare NYC to other major metro areas like Chicago or DC.\nBuild a predictive model for ridership based on remote work trends."
